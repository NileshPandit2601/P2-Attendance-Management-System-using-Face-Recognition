# Face Recognition-based Attendance Management System

## Overview

This project is a **Face Recognition-based Attendance Management System** that automates the process of recording student attendance. It leverages **Viola-Jones for face detection** and **Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for face recognition** to identify and mark the attendance of students based on their facial features.

The system aims to replace manual attendance recording, making it faster, more accurate, and more secure. With the integration of modern image processing and machine learning techniques, it provides a scalable and reliable solution for attendance management in educational institutions and workplaces.

## Features

- **Face Detection** using Viola-Jones algorithm.
- **Face Recognition** using Local Binary Patterns (LBP).
- Automated attendance marking based on facial recognition.
- Integrated with a database for student information and attendance records.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for capturing and processing attendance.
- Can be expanded for use in multiple classrooms or workplaces.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (for image processing and face detection/recognition)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Tkinter (for GUI interface)
  - SQLite (for database management)
- **Hardware Requirements**:
  - Camera (to capture images of students)
  - A computer with sufficient processing power for real-time face recognition.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have installed the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
- Python libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy pillow sqlite3 tkinter
  ```

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-attendance.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd face-recognition-attendance
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the project**:
   After installation, you can start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Capture Image**: The system uses a webcam or connected camera to capture an image of the student.
2. **Face Detection**: The captured image is processed using the **Viola-Jones** algorithm to detect faces.
3. **Face Recognition**: Once a face is detected, the **Local Binary Pattern (LBP)** algorithm is applied for face recognition, comparing the detected face against the stored images in the database.
4. **Attendance Recording**: If the face is recognized, the student's attendance is automatically marked in the system.

## Future Work

- **Mobile Integration**: Allow students to mark attendance using their smartphones.
- **Cloud Integration**: Sync attendance records across multiple locations in real-time.
- **Enhanced Recognition Models**: Use deep learning techniques (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) to improve face recognition accuracy.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Enhance the system to comply with data protection regulations like GDPR.
